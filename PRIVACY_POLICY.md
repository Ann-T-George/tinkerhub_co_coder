## Blinkin' Morse: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Blinkin' Morse app for Android!

This is an open-source Android app developed by Alwin John and Annie George as part of the TinkerHub Co-Coder Initiative. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by you is stored on your device only and can be erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email. I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
